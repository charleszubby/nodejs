This repository contains a series of tasks to help you practice basic Node.js concepts, including creating simple programs, setting up a server, file handling, generating passwords, and sending of emails through NodeJS.

firstly: I installed Nodejs package in my system through my terminal (using npm install)
I created a file named hello-world.js and also wrote a program and print it in my console.

I created a file named server.js and also wrote a program that runs on port 3000 and responds with '<h1>Hello Node!!!!</h1> when someone accesses http://localhost:3000

I created a text file named welcome.txt containing one line "Hello Node" and also wrote a program that reads the data from welcome.txt and logged it to the console.

I created a file named password-generator.js and i installed generate-password package through my terminal to create a function that generates random passwords and logs them to the console.

I created a file name email-sender.js and i installed a package called nodemailer though my terminal so as to implement email sending functionality.
